# Week 1:
Ok!  Here we go...  First assignment isn't too bad.  Mostly a redo of the the Advanced JAVA project.

# Week 2: 
Junit seems a bit off to me.  But then I am really not up on the idea of unit tests.  Saw them in Adv. PHP and they were of course used on us in Advanced Java, but actually using them on my own code is new.  I guess I see how that can help.

Log4j and more work with Git...  now that's exciting.

# Week 3
Ohhh..  Now this looks like fun.  I will need to play with this a hell of a lot more.  Look into how it gets processed and maybe find a way to put in some random functionality.  So manyu ideas, so little time.

# Week 4: 
I kind of feel like this is far more complicated than just doing SQL.  I can put SQL in a dao and work with it dynamically just fine, thats what prepared statements are for.  If this is how JAVA works in live developement then no wonder its considered hard.

# Week 5: 
... Huh?  This makes me question things.  Like Why is this class called 'Enterprise Java' and not something like 'Stuff to make Java more confusing'  Seriously?!  I really hope this Hibernate stuff starts to make sense, cause right now...

# Weeki 6:
Back to this.  I am really looking forward to learning more about how to user AWS.  We got our feet wet in Advanced PHP, but here we are getting to AWS more and maybe doing more with it.  Maybe I can manage to figure out how to push Never Winter Nights 2 up and actually run the server I want.

# Week 7: 
This is authentication?  Some questionable choices being presented here.  Need to look into ways to do this better.  Also, this hibernate this is a lot more work to deal with than it should be.  I am getting kind of concerned that my Indie Project might be a lot bigger a project because of all the extra work.

# Week 8: 
This is how the old APIs worked?  this is hurt if I ever see this in the wild.  At least they have a clearly defined structure. so that you can know how its used.  Still, this could be amusing to know, kind of like knowing BASIC.

# Week 9:
representational State Transfer in JAVA seems a littl eclunky to me.  But using the generic DAO technology  it does seem to make it easy to handle requests with multi types of data with the same general method.  Getting Java to produce JSON is kind of the opposite however.  It almost seems easier to manually convert an object, but that would be stupid with larger objects.  Maybe a toString method modified to make a toJSON method?

## Team Project thoughts and stuff.
