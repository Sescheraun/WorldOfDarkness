# Week 1:
Ok!  Here we go...  First assignment isn't too bad.  Mostly a redo of the the Advanced JAVA project.

# Week 2: 
Junit seems a bit off to me.  But then I am really not up on the idea of unit tests.  Saw them in Adv. PHP and they were of course used on us in Advanced Java, but actually using them on my own code is new.  I guess I see how that can help.

Log4j and more work with Git...  now that's exciting.

# Week 3
Ohhh..  Now this looks like fun.  I will need to play with this a hell of a lot more.  Look into how it gets processed and maybe find a way to put in some random functionality.  So manyu ideas, so little time.

# Week 4: 
I kind of feel like this is far more complicated than just doing SQL.  I can put SQL in a dao and work with it dynamically just fine, thats what prepared statements are for.  If this is how JAVA works in live developement then no wonder its considered hard.

# Week 5: 
... Huh?  This makes me question things.  Like Why is this class called 'Enterprise Java' and not something like 'Stuff to make Java more confusing'  Seriously?!  I really hope this Hibernate stuff starts to make sense, cause right now...

# Weeki 6:
Back to this.  I am really looking forward to learning more about how to user AWS.  We got our feet wet in Advanced PHP, but here we are getting to AWS more and maybe doing more with it.  Maybe I can manage to figure out how to push Never Winter Nights 2 up and actually run the server I want.

# Week 7: 
This is authentication?  Some questionable choices being presented here.  Need to look into ways to do this better.  Also, this hibernate this is a lot more work to deal with than it should be.  I am getting kind of concerned that my Indie Project might be a lot bigger a project because of all the extra work.

# Week 8: 
This is how the old APIs worked?  this is hurt if I ever see this in the wild.  At least they have a clearly defined structure. so that you can know how its used.  Still, this could be amusing to know, kind of like knowing BASIC.  On a non-class note, the PHP convention was this weekend.  I got a lot of things to talk about in the presentation, sad that I left my phone at school so no pictures.

# Week 9:
Representational State Transfer in JAVA seems a littl eclunky to me.  But using the generic DAO technology  it does seem to make it easy to handle requests with multi types of data with the same general method.  Getting Java to produce JSON is kind of the opposite however.  It almost seems easier to manually convert an object, but that would be stupid with larger objects.  Maybe a toString method modified to make a toJSON method?

## Team Project thoughts and stuff.
Started talking about this.  Kortney and John have the work pretty much devided up and they almsot seem to have left me out of the loop and the work.  So NOT going to hppen.  Will have to talk to them about it.

# Week 10:
## Team Project thoughts and stuff.
I am mostly doing research and using my own indie project as a test bed for the service we are building for Kortney's project.  the JSON is just not converting at all, dispite trying a handful of methods and libraries to make it work.  Really need some more input from Paula here.  we may just have to have jJohn work with text, or totally change our project here at the last minute.

# Week 11:
Multithreading. Yea,  done in like 5 hours!  Then Paula decided I should do more. lol..  Ok.  I am NOT goind to write the Dining Philosophers again.  As for my Indie Project... I am never gonna get that done in time.  Every time I open it to work on it I feel like something that was working is broken.  I should just done a hibernate powered Hello World.

# Week 12: 
Finally have the team project behind us.  That feels kind of poorly timed, sort of breaks the momentum for the idie project.

# Week 13:
I have my code telling itself a joke an darguing about being drunk.  I do love it when I can get something funny or silly into the code.  helps to relieve some of the stress of the project.

# Week 14: 
NOOOO...  Go back.  Too late in the semested and my job searches are kind of being fruitless.  Did the code review for Lisa, and I think I missed something.  I need to ask her how she got all those nice images for my code review.  I know it was from the code quality tool but I can't really figure out how to make it do that.  /me puts a dunce cap on.

# Week 15:
Here we are, game's almost over but I am not nearly ready for it to be.  this is the only class I have had here that has actually been a challange, and I could use a little more time of a couple of the subjects.  This needs to be divided into two classes, there is just too much to cover all at once.  Hell, hibernate alone should almost be a class. 

As I sit here and ponder my AWS database, which is still not working, I feel a littl miffed at myself, this may be the only coding class here that I am not going to get an A in/  I am a little worried about passing in general.  Least I don't need it to graduate.

# Week 16:
