It’s  said  that  the  abyss  gazes  back  if  you  stare  into  it  too  long,  and  House  Beaumayn  is  living  proof.  Thallain  and  members  of  the  Shadow  Court  can  sense  the  presence  of  members  of  House  Beaumayn  with  a  Perception  +  Kenning  roll  (difficulty  7),  with  success  indicating  that  they  are  aware  of  the  noble’s  presence.  This  will  not  reveal  the  exact  location  of  a  hidden  Beaumayn,  though  it  could  definitely  prompt  a  search.  Unless  given  compelling  and  immediate  reasons  otherwise,  Thallain  and  Shadow  Court  members  instinctively  go  out  of  their  way  to  harass,  torment,  and  even  outright  harm  Beaumayn  members  whenever  possible.  As  a  rule  of  thumb,  this  animosity  should  come  up  at  least  once  per  story,  if  not  more  often.
