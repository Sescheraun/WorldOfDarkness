The Leanhaun cannot normally digest glamour, they need glamour that is converted from life force to allow them to do so. In order to get this they select one special dreamer on whom they bestow the ability to create great works of art, and can feed from their life force, and the glamour around them afterward. To do so, however, comes at a high cost. As long as they have this special Dreamer an Artist they can recieve Glamour as Normal.

The dreamer's life is tragicly shorted. The Leahaun can prolong the artist's life by feeding only once a month but they will never live as long as they use to.

when the Leanhaun's Artist dies tragiclly young the Leahaun, has hard time functioning mentally and ages a year for each month the Artist has been dead, until they gain a new Artist.
