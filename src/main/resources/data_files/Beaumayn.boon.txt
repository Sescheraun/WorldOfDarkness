Dark  Stars  have  uncanny  senses,  particularly  when  it  comes  to  the  nuances  of  the  enchanted  world.  Beaumayn  receive  a  free  dot  of  Perception,  even  if  it  takes  them  above  5.  In  addition, they  receive  –1  to  the  difficulty  of  Kenning  rolls,  –2  if  they  involve  Thallain,  and  cannot  botch  a  Kenning  roll.

Additionally,  once  per  story  the  Storyteller  may  decree  that  a  Beaumayn  receives  a  prophetic  vision  or  dream.  The  exact  nature  of  these  prophecies  varies,  but  as  the  house’s  reputation  suggests  they  typically  focus  on  dark  or  disturbing  events  —  deaths,  betrayals,  disasters,  and  so  on.  While  they  can  be  symbolic  or  represent  multiple  possible  outcomes,  these  visions  are  never  outright  deceptive,  and  always  contain  some  useful  information.  Interpreting  these  dreams  for  maximum  benefit  requires  an  Intelligence  +  Enigmas  roll,  with  a  difficulty  equal to  9  minus  the  Beaumayn’s  Remembrance  rating.
