##Problem Statement
Running games across several environments makes coordinating with players for character creation kind of difficult ain the best of times   A solution to let them make characters in an online format and allow me to approve or discuss those characters when they are submitted would help to alleviate this issue. 

This project is just beginning.  Currently having no real content at all.
